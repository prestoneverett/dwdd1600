        <h1>Course</h1>
            <p><a href="https://stix.golf/blogs/rough-thoughts/the-ultimate-guide-to-golf-course-layout-for-beginners-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Golf Course is divided</a> into different parts with different levels of difficulty.  The basic parts are:  The Tee-box, the Fairway, and the green.</p>
            <p>Your aim in the tee box is to get your ball as close to the green as possible or in the fairway.  From the fairway, you hit your ball towards the green and putt into the Hole.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the ball often chooses a more roundabout way to get there. So on occasion, you may find yourself in <em>“uncharted territory”.</em></p>
            <p>Some parts of the course have their own rules, like hazards.</p>
            
            <h2>Parts of the Golf Course</h2>
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Tee box or teeing ground</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The Tee Shot is the first shot you take from a closely mown flat area, often on a mount. Each hole has more than one tee box. The color of the markers on the tee box indicate which one you’re playing from.You can tee up your ball anywhere between the 2 markers and up to 2 club lengths behind them (you can be standing outside this area).</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Fairway</strong></dt>
                    <dd>A stretch of closely mowed grass that extends, often in patches, from the tee to the green. Hitting your ball from the fairway is easier, because there’s no long grass to interfere with your shot. The clubs called FAIRWAY WOODS are used for long shots off the fairway.  Fairway woods include the Two (rarely used today), Three, Four and Five-woods. A curve in the fairway is called a dog leg left or right.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Green</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Putting surface with ultra short grass that surrounds the hole. Greens vary greatly in size and undulation. “Reading the green” is a real art which means figuring out which way the ball will turn on the slopes, breaking away from or towards the cup. The type of grass used, the time of day and the presence of water around the green will all have an inpact on your line of putting.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>Rough</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The parts of the golf course that are surrounding the fairways, the grass is kept higher and is less groomed than on the fairway or green. The rough is harder to play from, because the longer grass gets caught between the club face and the ball.</dd>
                </dl>

            <h2>Hazards - Areas to Avoid</h2>
                <p>The Hazards make Golf a challenging game by inserting difficult obstacles, Water hazards, Bunkers or Sand traps. The hazards are the most feared parts of the golf course because they add strokes to your score.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Water Hazard - a body of water situated between you and the green. In other words, your ball has to cross the water to get to the green.</li>
                    <li>Lateral Water Hazard - a body of water that borders the hole you are playing. In other words, your ball does not cross the water to get to the hole.</li>
                    <li>Fairway Bunker - an indentation or pit in the fairway, filled with sand.</li>
                    <li>Greenside Bunker - a sand trap in the immediate surrounding of the green.</li>
                </ol>
